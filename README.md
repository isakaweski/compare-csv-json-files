# compare-csv-json-files

Compare two files, one has the soft skills, and other the jobs I want to analize.

So, it has a counter that count how many times the soft skills appears on the job description.

To run, you just need to run the file `index.html` on your browser.

Then, you can insert the files requested:

- First the json file with jobs.

- Second, the CSV file with soft skills and it's translation.

I didn't made any magic things yet, but we have each soft skills with it's counter.
